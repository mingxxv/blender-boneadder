# blender-boneadder
Simple, probably useless Python script generator to add bones to existing bones in an armature in Blender.

Possibly useful for coders learning 3D modelling, or people who are lazy to rotate their viewport and add bones manually.

Or maybe I just haven't read the tutorial enough.
